    "\"\"\" Boosting is a machine learning ensemble technique that aims to improve the performance of a model by combining the predictions of multiple weak models, often referred to as \"weak learners\" or \"base models.\" The key idea behind boosting is to sequentially train these weak models, giving more weight to instances that were misclassified in previous iterations. The final prediction is then a weighted sum of the individual weak model predictions. \"\"\""
